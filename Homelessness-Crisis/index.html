    <h2> Homelessness Misconceptions</h2>
   <p> There are two main reasons why people refuse to help homeless people living on the streets:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>They believe that if they give a homeless person money, then they're just going to use it to buy drugs or cigarettes.</li>
       <li>They believe that homeless people are scary and disgusting. </li>
     </ul>
  </p>
