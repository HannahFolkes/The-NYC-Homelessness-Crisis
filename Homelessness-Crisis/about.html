 <main>
   <p>My name is Hannah Folkes and I live in Queens, New York. The reason why I choose to create a website advocating for the Homelessness Crisis, is because I want to spread more awareness on the daily problems that homeless people face. I feel like if people had a better understanding on their problems, then they will be more willing to help the homeless people that they see on the streets.</p>
